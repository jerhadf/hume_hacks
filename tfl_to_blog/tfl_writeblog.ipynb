      "Hello, world. What is up? Welcome to the Feelings Lab. I'm your host, Matt Forte. And on today's episode, we're talking about anxiety. I'm going to start this one off with kind of a heavy personal story, if that's all right. In the summer of 2019, I woke up one day, and my thumb was kind of tingly, you know, pins and needles, like I'd fallen asleep or something. By the end of that week, I'd lost sensation on the entire right side of my body. And not too long after that, after a myriad of scans, tests and whatnot, I was diagnosed with MS. Now, I'm glossing over a lot of details here, but don't worry, I'm fine. I've got a great doctor. I'm treating it. That's not the point. I share this because it was that moment in my life amidst all these physical challenges and scariness that anxiety really broke through the fourth wall for me and was no longer just a feeling that I experienced in fleeting moments before a big test or a live show. You see, before all of that, I thought of anxiety as something that like Tony Soprano had to deal with. And yeah, for sure, people around me discussed it, and I was aware, but I didn't have to worry about it. You know, I was fine. But all of a sudden, I was having many panic attacks and for whatever reason refused to believe that my mental hurdles could manifest physically. And so I thought the shortness of breath and the dizziness and everything I was feeling was a new MS symptom, and I was spiraling.\n",
      "Now, like I said, don't worry, I got a hold on most of that now and I'm getting better at it. And in retrospect, clearly I'd been navigating anxiety my whole life. It's ridiculous to have thought otherwise. But following my MS diagnosis, my awareness and understanding transformed dramatically. And thank God, honestly, because I can't imagine having to go through this pandemic without the tools I started to develop leading up to lockdown. Anyway, I wanted to start just by recognizing that anxiety in general for a lot of people can be a sensitive and heavy subject, myself included. Every day I learn something new. And today I'm sure we're going to learn a whole bunch of stuff together, because once again, I'm surrounded by some incredibly talented and smart individuals who are going to help answer and raise some big questions around this particular emotion. I have no doubt. Joining me here in the lab, Dr. Alan Cowan and Daniel Credit Cobb. Welcome back, both of you. Lovely to see you as always. And our extra special guest today, internationally renowned professor of clinical psychology, a pioneering researcher in the field of bereavement and trauma, chair of the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University. His latest book, The End of Trauma, How the New Science of Resilience is Changing How We Think About PTSD, is available now where all books are sold. Please welcome to the show. George Bonanno is here. George, thank you so much for being here. How are you doing, sir? I'm fine, Matt. Thanks. Thanks for inviting me. Oh, thank you for showing up. It's so great to have you here with us. We're excited to have you on today. We're going to have a great discussion. I want to jump right on in. But before I do, what kind of host would I be?\n",
      "I can't be without checking in on my co-hosts and friends. Danielle Allen, how are you guys doing? You doing all right? Doing great. Thank you, Matt. Very good. Danielle? Doing well. Always wonderful to hear. Doing well. Always wonderful to hear. I will report, given the topic, always have a tiny low-level anxiety before we actually start rolling. Then the conversation takes us away and we're fine, but I'm naming it to tame it, baby. I love it. I love it for sure. When it came time for me to choose what I wanted to share at the opening, I went for the big one. There is a baseline of anxiety that is constantly active for me these days that I've learned to work with. We'll get into that. Let's jump right in. When I can, I like to come out of the gate hot and get a nice definition of the feeling that we're discussing, so we have a better idea of what we're working with here. Allen, I'm going to put you in the hot seat. How would you define anxiety, sir? Wow, that's a tough one. In the literature, it lumps together a lot of things. People study stress, worry, the chronic anxiety that people feel that you've been talking about, the anxiety you feel when you're about to get hurt, that kind of thing. They're definitely all related. You see it in people's responses to anxiety drugs and you can cause non-human primates to feel anxiety and give them anxiety drugs and it reduces it. They're clearly all related neurologically and behaviorally, but I don't know that I can come up with a definition broad enough right now to encompass all of those things. I don't know. Maybe George can give it a shot.\n",
      "I appreciate it. I was gonna throw to George after you to see what he thought. George, how about you, sir? How would you define anxiety? Well, that it is a rather elusive topic. I study primarily how people respond to really horrible things that happen to them, like an MS diagnosis, or like a car accident, or, you know, just about any kind of other bad thing you could imagine. So I always, I'm always studying these reactions after one of one of these things happen. Anxiety is, you know, it overlaps a lot with what everybody knows is PTSD. And they share similar, they're similar. You know, anxiety is, you know, the classic piece of anxiety is this sort of undifferentiated foreboding, that something as bad as this could happen at any moment when there's no particular evidence for it. And we see that in some people after these events happen, people struggle with it. But it overdoes, as, as Alan pointed out, struggle, it, it overlaps with so many other concepts, at least a little bit. Totally. And, and forgive me to the listeners, because I know I tend to ask this question a lot. But it's something I'm genuinely very curious about in regards to Alan's work, when we talk about especially something like anxiety, I immediately want to know how you and your team were able to reproduce it or observe it in such a way to create the data sets and get the information that you used to inform yourself.\n",
      "It is designed to transform your emotion map. So, it's something that we struggle to put all the words together and just define how do you guys then observe it and recreate it and use that and find that information. How does that work for you guys, Alan? So, one way is to get people to self-report anxiety and compare it to other emotions, situating it in a broader space. We can see it sort of adjacent to fear, it's adjacent to excitement and those often overlap and relief. Generally, there's anxiety when you respond to something tense followed by either relief or something worse, something negative, depending on what the outcome is. But anxiety is this moment of tension and in film, it's suspense, right? And so, we can recognize that as a state that we all go through and it feels like butterflies in the stomach and tingling and all of that. There's an autonomic component of it, increased heart rates. There's a facial expression that we associate with anxiety that usually only occurs when people are really anxious. And then, in moments of sort of more persistent anxiety that's lower level, you see something called displacement behaviors. And you see this in humans and several other animals. And it's scratching or picking at your nails or biting your nails or, you know, all these different things that we do. Something we call like a nervous tick or something like that? Yeah. Well, nervous tick kind of you have the association that someone does all the time.\n",
      "Okay. With displacement behaviors, it's more specific to when you're feeling anxious, more specific to when you're feeling stressed. And that is one way to look at it. I mean, when we study anxiety, we're looking at facial expression, vocal expression, we certainly see it there. When you're looking at somebody over a zoom, I think it's difficult to see that this displacement behaviors, but when you're in person with somebody, I think you can actually see them. And it's quite evident and you end up comforting that person. Is it difficult to spot it over zoom? Because this is already just such a, there's such a weird layer of being removed from the, or is it just the fact that I'm framed very specifically and you can't see it? Why do you think it's harder to spot in this format? Well, I think with displacement behaviors, it's called displacement because you're kind of suppressing something. You don't want other people to necessarily see that you're anxious, but you're also seeing yourself on the screen and maybe there's displacement behaviors happening off the screen, but there's a sort of self-consciousness induced by zoom that I think erases some of the naturalness of emotional expression in everyday life. Interesting. What I'm hearing as we're talking about the definition of anxiety and how you're sort of recreating it and manufacturing it in the lab and whatnot, I'm not incorrect in saying it's tied to uncertainty, right? There's a level of uncertainty involved that sort of triggers it. Yeah. I see you nodding. Okay, good. Okay. So I am learning. Okay. I'm grasping it so far. That's good. That's encouraging. George, as someone, you know,\n",
      "Your research, you talked just a second ago about studying trauma and loss in the wake of which there is often a great deal of uncertainty. How does anxiety pop up for you in your work and be it in what you're observing or experimenting and things of that nature? Well, that's a really interesting question because what we find, you know, the research I do tends to show that most people are ultimately okay pretty soon after the event. But just about everybody, not completely everybody, I would say, you know, 85% of people exposed to one of these events. And I mean, these are things out of the ordinary that, you know, I tend to think of them as things we just don't want to happen that have happened. And they're often really threatening, often violent and life-threatening. When those events happen, just about everybody experiences at least a short-term reaction. We call it traumatic stress, but it definitely has an anxiety component. It's a sense that this could happen again. This event, you know, and it intrudes into our consciousness, even when we don't want it to. We have these, you know, unbidden images of thought and memory and an image, sound flashes into our mind. Regularly after the event happens, we have nightmares and we have this very serious, you know, level of arousal, level of definitely foreboding that this just happened. It could happen again. And\n",
      "And I'm totally on edge right now, and just about everybody experiences that sometimes for as short as a few hours, usually a few days, and sometimes a couple of weeks. And that's completely natural. It's a natural reaction. Something that you talk about in your work that I found really hopeful is, I mean, so other side of sadness actually came out the year that my brother died. So I'm grateful to you for that. Because it helped me look at it as an opportunity rather than as, you know, the kind of face on the floor thing that it can be. And anyway, so the idea that joy and focus can live within the experience of grief was really liberating. It's why looking at Alan's maps and knowing that there's an intimate space between excitement and anxiety. The question that comes up in me and something that you've talked about in your work is this concept of post traumatic growth, using strength to overcome adversity. And I would just, I mean, looking at where we are right now, too, we're not in an individual moment of grief and adversity, we're actually in a collective moment of grief and adversity that peaks and drops for all of us, perhaps at different points, but just your advice on on how to be with these things, based on all the stories you've heard, I'm just I would love to hear how post traumatic growth can be an option for us. Okay, well, I'm a little\n",
      "Danielle, I'm a little bit uneasy with the concept. Largely, this is more of an academic, I just don't like the measurement. There are measurement issues that we never really get at it. And the measurement is very poor. Measuring isn't really growth, but there is enough evidence that shows there is growth. It's very real. And I mean, I can attest to my own life. I've experienced growth. I think where that comes from, first of all, you talked about the bereavement research. And first of all, I'm sorry to hear about your brother. It must have been difficult. I'm very sorry to hear about that. But what we've seen in our bereavement research is that people spontaneously show these positive bits of happiness and joy. This is work I did with Dacher Keltner back in the 90s. And we've continued to look at these kind of things. So people show bits of joy even when they don't know they are. And that's what's kind of amazing. At the time, it was relatively unknown. And people assume, you know, when I'm feeling sad or I'm feeling anxious or nervous about what just happened to me, that I feel that way all the time. But, in fact, it's impossible to feel that way all the time. Our mind-body system just won't – it's just not possible. We collapse from that kind of exertion. But we have these moments where we shift into positive experiences.\n",
      "And I think the way that I understand how we, how we, how that happens, that we move on and how we, we focus on positive things is, is really, there's a broad model that I won't get into now. It's part of my book, it's the new book, and it's something I've researched, which is really flexibility. Flexibility is how we sort of work it out. And every situation, every challenge is unique, and we have to kind of confront it. And once we start doing that, it takes some effort to do that. There's lots of different pieces, you know, to that. But one of them is a mindset. When we get into that, you know, that sense of, I can do this, I will do this. So what do I need to do? When we do that, we immediately stop, well, I shouldn't say immediately, but we stop focusing on the long term threat. You know, this thing happened to me, God, I was so, why did this have to happen? And that's just a kind of a, you know, I guess that's necessary for at least a little bit to get ourselves going. But over the, it really doesn't get us much further than that, because it only makes us feel hopeless. But as soon as we start focusing on what we have to do, we almost immediately start feeling better. You know, we almost, we start to feel like, I can deal with this. I can solve this problem right now. And I've solved that problem. What's the next problem I have to solve? And it's sort of a chain of things. And that gives people a sense of mastery. It gives people...\n",
      "It gives people a sense of, you know, I can do this and that immediately makes people feel, I suppose you could call it growth right then and there, you know, there's a sense of, I can get through this, you know, and I think people have done this throughout the pandemic too, you know, there's a little bit of a sense, a little awareness would be able to say, oh, yeah, another one to get through, right, because they don't seem to stop, but you know, and we're all a little tired, but we've done remarkably well during the pandemic, you know, human beings have done remarkably well. The, the approach you describe of sort of focusing on what's in front of me, what do I have to do next is I connect to that very much so. And that's how I got through not just the story I shared in the beginning, but a story I shared a couple episodes ago about my family had a very traumatic, there was a house fire and it was very overwhelming. And it was just, I jumped into, it's been a, it's been a rough couple of years over in the Forte household. But yeah, but I, the way I've jumped into it is I've, what do we got to do? How do we handle this? What are the steps? What's the procedure? What's this? And I've struggled with, as, as much as that's helped me cope with the situations in front of me, I've also often worried, am I avoiding something by focusing just on what to do and what's in front of me? Is there something waiting for me once I run out of things to do and at the risk of turning this podcast episode into my own?\n",
      "I'd love to get thoughts on that idea and that concept, because it has worked for me, but there is this looming thing in the back of my mind of like, all right, well, you're busy now, but at some point you won't be. And then what am I going to do? Well, I then have to confront all these things that I haven't. Have you seen anything like that? What are your thoughts on that idea? I think that's a common reaction. And I think it comes from the bias that's inherent in all of these topics, especially highly aversive events, potentially traumatic events. A lot of understanding came from the clinical world, from mental health professionals. Now, I don't mean to dump on mental health professionals. I am a mental health professional, I suppose. Yes, I am. And I train mental health professionals in our program. It's a clinical psychology program. But the original work that was on these highly aversive events, these traumatic events, potentially traumatic events, came really from clinical observation from mental health professionals. Even the research was very much mental health focused. And that led to, there are a lot of biases inherent in that perspective. Therapists and mental health researchers tend to see primarily people who've been exposed to these events and can't get over them. They don't tend to see people who are resilient. People who are resilient don't go to therapy, typically, for an aversive event. And what we found, even in our research, we had...\n",
      "People who look pretty good after one of these events, they look resilient, we had a hard time getting them to come back because they thought, well, you don't want to see me. I'm fine, right? I don't want to ruin your research. So that perspective led to this kind of general idea that trickled out into the public that if you're not confronting it all the time, you're avoiding it. But the research is unmistakable on this side, that avoidance at times, distraction, suppression, those are all highly adaptive. And if you did nothing but that, that would be maybe cause for concern. But it is a sort of momentary or using that tool, it's a tool and it's an effective tool. Yeah. Is it a... Would that fall under a coping mechanism? Is that what that is? Or is that different? Well, I mean, there are coping mechanisms and there are emotion regulation mechanisms. I try to eschew those titles because people do whatever they do. So I mean, it is sort of a coping mechanism, it is an emotion regulation mechanism. And it could be whatever else you want it to be. Like say, getting drunk one evening just because you want to is useful at times, and I don't know if that's on anybody's list. Is that what you call an ugly coping mechanism? Yes, exactly. Yes, I used the term ugly coping back in the first book on the book...\n",
      "I've been talking about bereavement and I've continued to work with it, the idea because situations are so different, you know, they're so varied and in some situations, you just have to use something and in that particular moment, that's, you wouldn't even think it was healthy and other people don't think it was healthy, but it's going to work right at this moment. Because the goal is really just to get past the difficult part. And, you know, if you did this, what I call ugly coping, these things all the time, then you'd maybe be, you know, kind of have to question that. But at any given moment, it's the goal is really is John Lennon, I love the way John Lennon put it, whatever gets you through the night. All right, all right, you know. I think legally, that's as much of the lyrics as you're allowed to say. We always point taken. Well, sort of to jump off of that, in that, you saying like, Oh, so if that's what you need to do, if that whatever you need to get through the night, if that can anxiety, can it be good? I feel like there's a negative connotation with anxiety. And I think of anxiety, I just have, like I said, negative, I think negative thoughts, but can, can it be a good thing? Can it be reframed? Can it be harnessed in some way? Or am I thinking about it the wrong way? But the simple question is, can anxiety be good? Well, yes, I think that's been around for a long time. I mean, I just was one of my students did her dissertation today. And she.\n",
      "She told me she was very anxious about it. And I mentioned to her, if you weren't anxious, I would be concerned, because dissertations are a big deal. And a little bit of anxiety in that moment is, I think, very useful, because it gets you geared up, gets you focused. It's not pleasant, but if you put it in that context, it's a natural response, which is useful at that moment. I'm actually curious, Alan, about when you're, what you see in your mapping, because like what we were talking about earlier, this idea that anxiety and excitement are adjacent to each other. Something that I really loved in the mind search that was coming out of Stanford and UT Austin, I think David Yeager, Chris Bryan, Dweck were working on this together, this idea that the story that you're telling yourself or your construal, of course, is the difference between those two spaces. And so, I'm just curious what both of you think, but Alan, specifically computationally, the way you see it cranking out, it's like, is it the story you tell yourself that makes a difference? Your construal of that, whether stress becomes debilitating or enhancing, whether anxiety perhaps does the same thing, given that's what's agitating the system? Yeah. I mean, it's interesting. We see the same people respond to certain stimuli with anxiety and other people with excitement. Whereas there are individual differences that will determine whether somebody construes something.\n",
      "I think Spike Jones and oh my god, Johnny Knoxville's whole series, Jackass, is based on that adjacency. Right. Yeah, it's true. What makes them, of course, tense is that they're real. You go to movies all the time and usually it's exciting when things like that happen. Generally speaking, when we watch people watch those videos, their reaction is not so bad until they see somebody actually fall off the building and then the rest of the videos are much more anxiety inducing for them. So, I think it really depends on your experience, how you construe the context, what you construe is like the different possibilities to consider. And some people are just looking for what can go wrong all the time. Of course, we need that in our society. So, there's some room for that, not only on the personal level because it can get you out of bad circumstances, but also on the social level because somebody needs to be worrying about the worst possible outcome. And we, you know, all of these, you know, every negative emotion, every positive emotion is useful in some way. At least it was useful to us. So, that's a perfect segue because that's something I was super curious about, but I don't want to cut George. Did you have any thoughts or in response to Danielle before I pivot us away?\n",
      "Well, I don't know if this is exactly on the spot in response to what Alan just said, and what Danielle just said. But when we do these different patterns after a potential traumatic event, we always see most people are resilient, but some people are always unable to return to baseline. They're always chronically distressed and some people recover. But we've seen these patterns, and I think, riffing off what Alan just said, there might be something adaptive for the species about this, because we've seen it in laboratory mice and other types of non-human animals, basically. There's something about that that must be useful on some level for the species, for some people just to be overwhelmed. Because they tell us, this is a bad situation. So it's a very interesting idea, very interesting topic. Yeah, it sounds like we might have already covered everything I was going to get out of this, but I'll squeeze this orange and see if there's some more juice. But keep me honest here, Alan. This is one of the first feelings we've tackled on this show, that as far as I can tell, it doesn't actually serve in any obvious way to bring people together. We talked about the evolutionary advantage to awe and desire and horror and how that brings people together. But I feel like anxiety can cause a person to isolate and avoid others, as opposed to bring people together. So if we have any more thoughts on the use of the word, I'd love to hear them.\n",
      "etuned to potential threats and some monkeys that are less attuned. And so I think diversity and the levels of anxiety is probably something that's to our evolutionary advantage. Why did monkey in the bush not catch on like canary in a coal mine? Is it because there is an alliteration? Well, the canary usually doesn't do well at the end of that story. I was picking up the same thing. I was like, monkey in a bush is definitely an expression. We're going to make that catch. It's a more positive take. Do you think that sort of starts to dovetail into the other thing that I was curious about, which is why some people have a harder time than others? Obviously, I don't think there's a blanket answer to this question. If we had it, we'd already have some sort of miracle treatment to help everybody be where they want to be. But I do wonder why is it I can abate a lot of my anxiety either through exercise or tasking?\n",
      "And strategies that can use that others and there's that's very, very clear in the research or individual differences, but it's also possible for people to develop new skills and new strategies. It just it's very hard to do. It's very hard to do when you're in the middle of something. So it easier to do when when when your life is calmer. But so you know, I think many people don't think about doing that and then something happens and they live with what they've got to use. But I think that's really the key is that just some people have more strategies their disposal, for whatever reason, is it? Oh, go on. Yeah. What were you gonna say? I was just gonna ask, have you found a correlation between one's level of resiliency and the likelihood of them suffering from some kind of anxiety disorder? Is resiliency directly correlated to their repertoire? Well, I don't think of resiliency as a thing people have.\n",
      "I think of resilience as an outcome. Resilience is what you are if you've endured something effectively, because you only can be resilient in relation to something. There are a lot of myths about resilience. One of them is that you have the magic pieces of it, and then you're resilient, the key traits. There's no end to these kind of ideas. There are five traits, or seven, or eight, or three. You see them in the media a lot, but you see them also in some of the professional literature. In fact, when we do research on what correlates with resilience, the outcome, there's no end to the things we can measure. We've really found probably 20 things right now that correlate with resilience. When I was preparing for this book, I did a quick Google search of the traits of resilience, and I came up with 50 different things in less than an hour. I just stopped there, because it's preposterous. We ask always, what is the evidence for these things? There are quite a few that we found evidence for. What's really remarkable about this is that almost none of these traits does very much to predict who will be resilient. In statistical terms, we say they have small effects. We've done a number of machine learning studies where we had 70 or 80 variables to predict who's resilient. We have things that you can't even see, like blood. We get blood in\n",
      "We can measure immune functioning and stress, and even things like blood chloride levels, which are all to some extent correlated. And when we do these computational models, we get a better prediction, but it's still not very good, because all the individual pieces are small. And that trouble, that dilemma, I should say, I call that the flexibility paradox, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, the resilience paradox. It's, it's dinnertime here in New York. So I'm a little bit, a little bit depleted. We call it, I call it the resilience paradox, which is, you know, the fact that we can identify all these things that we still can't predict who will be resilient and who not, when something bad happens, and that led me to see the links to flexibility. It's all about knowing what's happening to you, and what you need to do at any given moment, what you're able to do. And almost invariably, what we try when something bad happens to us, doesn't necessarily work, because situations are so diverse, so we try something else. And that's part of the key to the whole sort of, the whole flexibility idea is that, you know, you try something until something works, and then you, you know, move on to the, you know, you move on, and you come up with another problem tomorrow, and you try something else. And you can try what you tried yesterday, and it may or may not work, whether you have to kind of take stock and pay.\n",
      "And so it's a complex process. It's really a process. And you have the larger you, the more things you have at your disposal, the more strategies, the more, you know, the more of a behavior repertoire you have. And again, this is where you can engage in coping ugly. Sometimes just say, Okay, I'm just going to do this for now. I'm just going to get drunk, or I'm just going to go to a movie and stop thinking about it completely for two hours and go out with my friends. It will still be there, but I'll deal with it. You know, later, and that gives us some relief, you know, so it's a, it's an elaborated process of trying to find what works. So is your I'm so curious about this, because I'd actually read about the your, you know, the naming of the resilience paradox, the flexibility mindset, and something I was curious about is, so whatever you call it, what it maybe it's the repertoire building, but it's like in those times of calm, like you said, how do you develop? How can you cultivate things that can serve you when, you know, when the thing goes down? So I'm curious, the kind of practical advice for not necessarily like being a doomsday prepper in the emotional space, but more like what, what, what do we do when we have a little space that that can serve us well in the times when we don't? Yeah, that's, I'm glad you brought it up, Danielle. So it is possible.\n",
      "I've been able to develop all of these pieces, and it isn't only as a to prepare for doomsday, because these behaviors, these strategies, these whatever you want to call them, the mindset of the sequence, they're applicable to daily life. And really, I think at the time I began to figure this out or put it together because I've been doing research on these pieces separately for a long time. And at one day, I don't know when exactly I began to see how they fit together. And that was a little bit of an epiphany for me. But then I could see using them my own life. I'd be unhappy about something, as I mentioned, maybe I didn't mention it on the show that I have had been raising children in New York City. And that comes with the financial concerns and all kinds of other things. And there are times when you're feeling, I'm feeling pretty bad, what is going on? And then you begin to realize, okay, well, what is happening right now? And what is it that's making me feel this way? And what can I do about it? And you know, did I try? What can I do? What am I able to do? And is it working? So all of these things are learnable, and they can be cultivated, because we actually learn them as children. We learn to say, for example, differentiate different situations as children. My favorite, the classic example is, is when a child is told, you use your inside voice here, you know, and that's essentially the\n",
      "The caregiver, the parent or the teacher is essentially saying, this is a different situation. So we learn that as into adulthood, we continually do this all the time. We just don't, or we're just not aware of it. I get on the subway almost every day. Subways can be mean and lean types of events, types of context. And especially during the pandemic, when things have gotten a little bit chaotic in New York City during the pandemic, you get on the subway car, every New Yorker immediately looks around the subway car and does a quick assessment. You know, is this good? Should I sit over here? Is it going to be okay? Should I put my head down? Should I, you know, and, and you can always, I live right by Columbia University where I teach. Every year the new students show up and you can see them on the subway. They don't know yet, you know, they're not paying attention. And that's really just monitoring the context. We do it without being aware of it, but becoming aware of it already gives us kind of a leg up and we can begin to try to, you know, enhance that skill. The flexibility mindset is really just an attitude about, you know, getting ourselves into the game. I like to put it that way. It's really, it's, it can be, it's, I think of it in terms of optimism, challenge appraisal, you know, thinking of events as threats as challenges and confidence in coping. It doesn't have to be those three pieces, but they work together really nicely and together they kind of form this mindset.\n",
      "I can do this, I'll do what it takes, but we can anyhow, any way we do that, get into that mindset, you know, is workable. Yeah. And then the sequence is the steps that I just described, you know, reviewing the context, having you go looking to your repertoire, correcting all of those pieces. In the book, I suggested some self-talk to go along with all of those, riffing off the work of Ethan Cross, I think is really nice work. And you know, self-talk has been around for a long time. And so we can practice self-talk and, you know, there's a research showing we can build all those things if, you know, with a little bit of effort. So it just takes, I think, partially being aware of this is how it works for most people. You're probably using it too, but you just don't know it. So I'm curious actually, and I don't know Ethan Cross's work, but what I heard you saying was that basically in that moment when the feelings are going down, that you have a level, you bring it into your awareness, you get conscious to it, you're aware of it, and then you have an inquiry. So I'm curious if you can give us, or if you have even your own process too, this doesn't have to be peer reviewed research, but even just your personal experience, what's your favorite kind of couple of question rundown for yourself if something shows up? I love things like this, especially from scientists.\n",
      "Like yourself and Alan, because these are the types of things that really help science to change his life. Right? Well, yeah. And it's a great question. I'm sorry. I'm hesitant. I had a recent experience that was pretty difficult, and I don't want to, to rival Matt for this story of the evening. But the questions that I often ask myself really are the mindset, I think I'm a basically optimistic sort of can do person. I don't, you know, I've always felt like I can solve the problem. Just tell me. There's a great quote from Einstein. I don't remember the exact quote, but it's something like, if you give me an hour to solve a problem, I can solve it, but I need the first 55 minutes to figure out what the question is. Once I have the question, I'll solve the problem. And I think it's a little bit like that, where you just say, okay, I can do this. You know, what's happening? I can do this. You know, I'm pretty good at solving things and, you know, so what is it, the challenge? What is it that I need to focus on? So, I mean, those are questions, you know, that there are things you can say to yourself for this mindset idea, but it's a more broader idea, but for the sequence, it's really what's happening to me? What do I need to do? What am I able to do? And is it working? Those simple questions, I mean, I find myself doing that all the time in my own life.\n",
      "With whether it be going down to the laundry room and finding like, the laundry machine isn't taking my credit card, you know, I live in a building with the laundry, or, you know, learning the other day, I went down to the laundry, and I went back home, and my door was locked. And, you know, I texted my wife, where are you? And she said, Oh, I went to vote. I'm sorry, didn't you know? And so, you know, then it's okay. What do I do? I could be really upset right now, because I'm standing in the in the in the hallway of my building, barefoot with my laundry, you know, I did have my mask, luckily. But you know, then you think, Okay, what do I need to do here? You know, and you go through the steps. And that's a, that's a concrete problem. But you know, you can use the same steps in that way. And I think we do, again, we just don't know we do. And it just really helps to, you know, it's very useful to think about these explicitly. And, you know, realize this is typically what I might do. But sometimes, sometimes I'm anxious. And I'm not thinking clearly. Which is actually what we've we learned clinically from various colleagues of mine work with, with really high stress, high adversity situations, medical problems, or, you know, in in the in the hospitals. And they've they try to walk people through these stages. And these these these sequence that I described, and, and some of those people say, Well, I don't have I can't do anything else. I don't know how to do anything else. And when we're feeling anxious,\n",
      "That's what it feels like. I don't know how to do anything else. I love the idea. Like, and this is a million years ago from a therapist actually shared this with me. But what I realized that there's beautiful moment where you realize you're in one of your patterns. And it's this thing where she was like, if you notice these things happening, you're doing the thing you're doing that thing you do. And if you can just muster the ability to say, Oh my god, I'm doing the thing. Okay, now what do I do? That's the strategic thing you're talking about. I love the idea. Ask yourself those questions. What's going on? You know, it's nice to think, okay, pull out the card and just follow the thing versus like, having to put alone in that moment. Because of course, the beautiful thing about emotion is we all got the same ones, and we all go through our patterns with them. So there's like the promise of if you can just realize that one thing, then you can change your behavior. It's exciting. Yeah. And I've never been in a situation yet in my own personal life where it wasn't helpful to go through that little set of questions. And I think in our research, we find that most people are in fact flexible, they can do these things, they measure them. And, you know, I was relieved when we found that, because I built a lot of arguments on that finding it, I was kind of hoping and, you know, my one of my students did the research. So, you know, to keep my hands off it. So I didn't bias the results in any way. But if most people are flexible, then the question is, do they know they're flexible?\n",
      "I think most people don't, when I give public talks on this, people often say, so what is it again, you know, without realizing, I was gonna ask how much do you attribute because you obviously have like, you have your your patterns and you have your your procedure and your process and your questions that you ask. And you're very comfortable in this space. How much do you attribute that comfort in the place that you're at to working on it, being cognizant of it and putting an effort versus how much you were born with? Because just your story outside of your professional career is a remarkable story in the way that you set out into the world. I forget what interview I was watching and you said when you were 10, you started sleeping without a pillow to prepare yourself for the future to sleep in fields without a pillow. And so you strike me as someone that's always had the I can do this attitude, but that's just my perception from stories I've heard. Did you always have it? Did you have to work on it? And did you have to work on it at an early age at 10? Were you thinking of these things? I wish I could answer that question conclusively. I mean, the reason my earlier life was actually filled with a lot of difficulty. And in my own, in my home, my father was a very, it's a long story. His parents were Sicilian immigrants and he grew up really with almost no education and had a family to support. But he was somewhat overwhelmed.\n",
      "with the stress of trying to support that family without an education, and he had several heart attacks. And I knew, I think I picked up intuitively that he had regretted that he never traveled. And I saw for some reason, but I mean, that's, that's a sort of a post hoc explanation, but may or may not have had that, that those built in, in a way, you know, but in the book, I tell the story of a guy, he began begin the book with him, and end the book with him. And he pops up throughout, among other people, I told the stories of, and he was had a horrific accident, he was run over by a sanitation truck and garbage truck, and just crushed his all the wheels, you know, those things like 25 tons when they're filled. And then he had other things happen to him along the way, there were all kinds of secondary because his body was essentially rebuilt. And he had all kinds of secondary, you know, health consequences that made his life extremely difficult. But he showed this, he showed flexibility, as I've described it, in coping with those things. But he had no idea he was doing that. And at some point, I think when the other mounting difficulties in his life, he had to figure out what it is, as he was doing. The first chapter of the book, I said, I guess it's the introduction is\n",
      "Why was I doing okay? Which he asked himself, when he first recovered from the accident, why was I doing okay? And he didn't know. And he wanted to know. And I think it was a question he may or may not have answered until he had more things pile up on it. And he really had to find some answers. And he gradually worked his way to understand flexibility. And he uses it now, you know, routinely. Now, I also know him. And I have no doubt along the way, he's learned what I do. And he's actually worked with me at one point. But I think he already had done this, you know, without knowing. And I think the bottom line is he had to learn it. He had to figure it out. Because he knew more was coming down the road. And he needed to figure out how he was going to get through it. But you know, I think, I just think to put a finer point that there isn't there, it's possible for everybody to learn these things. Because as we've seen, as I mentioned, most, most people do it already. Most people know it already with it without most people can do these behaviors without knowing. That's what it would do. For sure. We're coming into the homestretch. We got a couple of minutes left here. But there was one thing that I also really wanted to tackle. So I'm sorry if this is too hard of a pivot here. But part of my reluctance, you know, retrospect, like looking back, and with hindsight, I understand this now, part of my reluctance to accept that I'm\n",
      "I was having panic attacks at the time and was part of this reaction to the trendiness of anxiety and my perception of it becoming this kind of like catch all for the world's woes. But even if it is trendy, I'm not sure that's necessarily a bad thing because more people talking about it certainly has to be better than people ignoring it, right? You want more awareness so we don't go back to the days of enemas and exorcisms. So it's like, okay, maybe the trendiness thing isn't a bad thing, but I'm only thinking that now. So I was like, let me ask smart people, what are the, what is the group's thoughts here? Has it become trendy? And if so, is that a bad thing? I mean, I would say that the way that it's studied clinically, and I think George and I kind of agree here in the way it's assessed is really, really broad. And that sort of has led to this classification of people having anxiety when, you know, in fact, the survey asks, the surveys they're typically used ask not just about the feeling of anxiety, but, you know, are you content? And that has to do with positive emotion and all these other things. And then the things that we classify as anxiety disorders may be things that involve a lot of emotions other than anxiety. So I mean, there's generalized anxiety disorder, but then there's also phobias which are classified as anxiety disorders. So phobia does really involve fear and then, you know, potentially social anxiety disorder may involve more embarrassment and OCD may involve disgust as well. So there's other emotions involved.\n",
      "So, I think there would be a lot of value in dissecting these things. In terms of, you know, what do anxiety drugs do, what are the treatments, if you're treating things with drugs, it is sort of a big mallet that you can crush a lot of things with. You can lower your heart rate, you know, you can take beta blockers and so forth. And those will physiologically work at reducing some of the physiological symptoms of anxiety, but they don't really, I don't think, tackle some of the root causes, which have to do with, you know, the emotional appraisals that cause the anxiety. Some of the extrinsic factors in our society separate yourself from social media, maybe, or separate yourself from the things that are preventing you from sleeping properly, or, you know, if you're smoking, that might be causing anxiety. So, there's a lot of other factors to consider. And when you probably when you piece apart all the different symptoms, you'll be able to start to tackle what the underlying causes are. That's my opinion. Got it. That is so fascinating, Alan, what you, especially the part when you talked about how it's almost like, and again, I'm sort of pairing this with what George was sharing around strategies. It's like your ability to say, okay, anxiety is here, go through the questions, but then also it's like anxiety is here, what other emotions are here? How do I look in, you know, how do I have a little more granularity here? It's why your maps are so amazing.\n",
      "Ils objectifs sont incroyables. Ils montrent ce qui se passe autour de nous et même pour cette personne particulière, si l'anxiété est présente et l'embarrassement est présent, c'est une clé à la stratégie qui va me servir le mieux dans ce moment. Et ça me rend compte de ce beau quote de Rumi, qui est que les douleurs et les sentiments que vous avez sont envoyés à vous comme messagers de l'au-delà, écoutez-les de près, ils sont messagers de l'au-delà. And I just love this idea that we are tuning in and that inquiry way that the messages are clear. And then knowing how to support yourself can also be clear just with that little process. And also, because we have two incredible scientific minds here, just as a nerd candy moment, I'm curious of your studies. What is your like favorite aha, it can be recent, it can be old. I'm just so curious, a moment where a light went on for you, because you maybe saw how it could practically live or just like, George, you were saying that you had this epiphany because you kind of had this quantum mechanics relativity moment where they, your theories started to come together. So I just have to ask him the nerd in me is like, whoo. I don't know if I can answer that, because I don't think I have enough short term memory left to call the mind. But you know, I do, I do think that the focus that there can be too much focus on anxiety and the trendiness.\n",
      "Some of it I think worries me, for example, we have these things in the general population of trigger warnings, and you hear this word all the time, trauma informed. And I think those are really dangerous trends because they kind of communicate that everybody's harboring vulnerabilities. And I think that underestimates how strong people are and how capable people are when bad things happen. For example, trigger warnings, this is not exactly in response to Daniel's question about aha moments, but Rich McNally was one of my favorite researchers at Harvard, did studies on trigger warnings. And he basically found that when you give people trigger warnings, you know, controlled design compared to not, it actually makes people more anxious than not getting it. Because it tells people, well, I'm going to show you something that's going to make you really anxious. And it actually does that. And I think that the whole idea of trauma informed, again, it suggests to people that there's hidden things that are going to lurk up, you know. And I just did recently did an interview with a British newspaper, and they asked me, so I think it was Prince Andrew, I get them, I get those confused, the princes. But I think what Prince Andrew quoted is saying that most people are carrying around wounds and trauma, wounds and loss.\n",
      "And so, that's just wrong. You know, people go through things, but most people go through them and they move on and they don't carry those wounds with them. They might carry the memory, they might carry the lessons they learned, and the sense that they got through it, but I don't think they're carrying these open wounds with them, these vulnerabilities. Some people are, who've been really at a hard time. So, I think this preoccupation with the societal level is not the healthiest thing right now. Got it. Alan, you look like you're about to say something or are you disagreeing? No, I agree 100%. The funny thing about anxiety is it's one of the emotions that when you think too much about anxiety, it actually makes you anxious. I think during this podcast I've been more anxious than any other podcast. Oh, Alan, I'm so sorry. I began talking about displacement behaviors and then the whole time I've been like... For those people just listening, you can't tell, but Alan has sweat through three shirts already. We haven't mentioned it, but it's happened. So, in that way, the preoccupation with anxiety could be a little bit dangerous. It might be causing people anxiety. I honestly think that might be true. There's also, yeah, I mean, thinking of everything as one emotion, I think also...\n",
      "And I think that's really makes people's responses to the emotion kind of one dimensional. So everything is about reducing the anxiety. Well, if you're embarrassed, maybe it's about, you know, sort of responding to a social situation. If you're disgusted, maybe it's about thinking about what it is that's really grossing you out. You know, maybe if you reappraise what it is that's causing the more specific emotions, you can come, you can combat them more easily. If you just kind of put them all in the anxiety bin, then you're just going to say you need drugs. So I think that's another dangerous thing about it. In terms of the studies that I think have influenced my thinking recently, I mean, I do all my work on humans. And so I love reading the animal literature. Yeah, sorry. That's always where we end up anyway. Just to give George some background, I don't know how I did this, but I've made it. So at this point, I'd say it's a segment. We pretty much land on every episode. I ask Alan, even though this is not his area of expertise, but he does know a lot about it. I ask him about things we know scientifically of observing the emotion in question within the animal kingdom. And so I see you've already you've instinctively segwayed there for us, Alan. Thank you. But we've talked a little bit about that, but I didn't mean to cut you off. But just to provide context as to why that was so funny to all of us.\n",
      "Our first episode will be translated to English so make sure to tune in and don't miss it! more interesting studies on anxiety and on the displacement behaviors that they're associated with is that they tend it tends to happen when people are intimidated um in a social context when the alpha male goes and intimidates somebody or when there's a dispute over food and somebody loses and then what happens is there's an animal in the corner you know usually a primate uh exhibiting displacement behaviors and particularly with apes and i think to some extent with primates as well you then see another ape come over and comfort them and then the displacement behaviors go away and when i read a lot of the animal literature i you know it focuses often on the social functions of emotions and oftentimes it's in terms of specific behaviors that have clear parallels in humans but first they talk about the behaviors displacement behaviors some monkey comes and comforts the other monkey like these are really valuable things and then um they talk about parallels between those behaviors and their neural correlates and the neural correlates of the feelings that we have that we associate with those behaviors in humans to say look you were\n",
      "It's not just saying that this animal is feeling the way the human does when it's doing something similar, because that would be sort of anthropomorphizing that behavior. It's also the case that what's going on in their brain is similar to what's going on in human brains when we feel anxiety. So I think those kinds of studies are really, really interesting to read, and I follow that literature pretty closely. There's a similar literature on mice actually, and when mice are distressed, other mice come over and kind of help them naturally. And the other mice exhibit signs of kind of empathic distress, which is also very interesting. That is fascinating. It's fascinating as well. Yeah. When you shut off the expression of the distress by the mouse, then the other mouse doesn't come over too. So like if you lock this mouse in a cage and it's doing the distressed behaviors, the other mouse comes over and unlocks it. It only locks from the outside. And then if you turn off the expression, the mouse doesn't help. So I think that expressions really have this critical social function. And so thinking about those expressions in that context is really important, and it's a good way to think about emotions having an important social function. Yeah, the idea that sadness is a beacon. That's a beautiful thought. Yeah. Yeah. Would it be okay time-wise if I add something to what Alan was describing? Please do. Absolutely. So I think that's absolutely fascinating, Alan. Thanks a lot for bringing that up. So I have a comment that I think addresses animal literature and also Danielle's question.\n",
      "Which was actually a study I was in, several studies I was involved in related to animals. Now, I don't have animals in my lab. And I have not gotten involved in any previous animal research. Usually, I don't like to be in studies where animals are killed. I understand that that's that's, you know, a part of animal research. But literally, every time I've seen animal researchers present something, I've asked them, well, you know, does this all happen to all the animals? Usually, it's rodents. Does this happen to all of them? So for example, like social defeat, where you can make a mouse, you know, cower and stops, stop exploring by putting a big mouse in there that beats them up on a regular basis. And, you know, and that's called social defeat. There's also fear extinction of these classic paradigm. Social defeat is actually really interesting, just that they can do it. But I once asked a panel of animal researchers, what about variation in these behaviors? I study individual differences in humans, you get to all all rodents, you know, show this pattern. And they looked at each other and said, you know, I don't know. And someone came up to me actually, after the panel was over and said, you know, I do social defeat research, and there are animals who don't show this. I said, How many? And they said, I don't know. So we we collaborated with Joe Ledoux down at NYU, he's in the same city. So we have enormous respect for Joe Ledoux, Joe's\n",
      "And he had these rodents who were, you know, running through fear extinction travels classic, you know, psych 101, kind of a thing. And, and we decided to look at the individual differences. And this was the aha moment, we found that there were very clear individual differences. And most of these rats, they were they were not subway rats, which I don't know what they would do, they'd probably just break out and, you know, steal the pizza. I don't know. But these were, these are standard genetically homogenous laboratory rats. And they, they most of them extinguished fear in this thing, you know, they matched them with a tone, an electric shock on the first day, and the second day, they get they only get the sound, and they freeze, which is their defensive behavior. And that's the sort of the main measure of this sort of fear of behavior. Most of them got, you know, extinguished, they stopped doing it really quickly, whereas the average shows it takes much longer. So the majority just like in humans, you know, simple kind of behavior. And then some showed this more gradual response, and then some never stopped freezing the entire experiment. And that was remarkably, like the overlap with human patterns is remarkable, the variation that we've it's been replicated now four or five times in other studies that my, my, my student and now absolutely brilliant researcher Isaac Gelzer-Levy has gone on to do all kinds of wonderful computational things. He's replicated this a number of different\n",
      "Exactly. No birds were harmed in the cobbling together of that last sentence. I do, unfortunately, got to wrap things up before we get out of here. A massive, massive thank you to our guest, George Bonanno, for being here with us and being so generous with your time, sir. It has been amazing to have you here and share your experience, your insights and your thoughts. Sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you. It's been my pleasure. Awesome. Thank you so much. Friendly. That's so kind of you. Thank you, sir. Friendly reminder to those listening and watching out there, check out his latest book, The End of Trauma. How the new science of resilience is changing how we think about PTSD. Like I said, it's available right now where all books are sold. Thank you to my co-hosts and friends, Danielle and Alan, for being by my side. Couldn't do it without you. And to those listening, thank you for listening. If you enjoyed hanging out with us today, help spread the word. Give us a nice little review. Throw a couple of stars our way. You don't have to do any of these things, but be a part of it.\n",
